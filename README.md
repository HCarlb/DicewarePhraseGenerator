# DicewarePhraseGenerator
 
A **Diceware** project in pure **.Net6+** to generate passphrases.
Inspired by https://theworld.com/~reinhold/diceware.html



### Note!
If you are looking for really secure passwords you can still use the wordlists, but 
use real dices, pen and paper instead to generate your passphrases.
